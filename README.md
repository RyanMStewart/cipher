# cipher
A simple string cipher application

The task at hand involves implementing a substitution cipher, a straightforward method to conceal a string by substituting its letters based on a given mapping. Let's consider an example:

Here, we have a cipher: 'mpgzkeyrsxfwIvjbcnuidhoqat' and a standard alphabet: 'abcdefghijkImnopqrstuvwxyz'. In this mapping, every character in the cipher corresponds to and substitutes the equivalent letter in the alphabet. As a result, 'm' replaces 'a', 'p' replaces 'b', and so on. Consequently, a word like 'abs' transforms into 'mpu'.

Input Example:
The plain text that needs encoding is: 'helloworld'
The cipher to be used for substitution: 'mpgzkeyrsxfwIvjbcnuidhoqat'

Output Example:
The encoded result is: 'rkwwjojnwz'

Explanation: Based on the provided cipher, the word 'helloworld' is encoded into 'rkwwjojnwz'.
